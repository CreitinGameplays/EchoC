### EchoC, a Python-inspired programming language written and compiled with C
*I had nothing to do so...*

Ensure you have `Python 3.10>` installed (for compilation) and GCC (linux recommended because linux is goated).

Compile:
```
python3 echoc_compiler.py
```

Optionally, you can debug errors with valgrind/heapusage:
```
valgrind -s --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes --show-leak-kinds=all ./EchoC temp.echoc
valgrind -s --tool=helgrind ./EchoC test_codes/async_test.echoc 
heapusage ./EchoC test_codes/async_test.echocC
```
